# Hi there! 👋  

I'm a Data Science with a strong background in computational mathematics, machine learning and meteorology. Passionate about understanding and predicting atmospheric phenomena, I have been working on Graph Neural Networks applied to meteorological data for my final degree project.

## 🚀 About Me  
- 🎓 **Graduate in Computational Mathematics & Data Analysis** at the **Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona**.
- 🌤️ I have experience in **data science**, **meteorology**, **diferent programming languages** and **machine learning**, focusing on neural networks and big data analysis.
- 📡 My final degree project involves **Graph Neural Networks** for meteorological applications, leveraging high-performance computing resources at the **Computer Vision Center**.
- 📺 I’ve had the opportunity to work with the **3Cat meteorology team**, gaining hands-on experience in weather forecasting and climate analysis.
- 📖 Next academic year, I'll be pursuing the **Master’s in Meteorology and Climate Sciences** at the **University of Barcelona**.

## 💡 Interests & Skills  
- **Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Artificial Intelligence** 🧠  
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** 🔗  
- **Meteorology, weather forecasting, environment, renewable energy & climate change** ⛅  
- **Big Data Processing & Analysis** 📊
- **High level of Catalan, Spanish, and English**, and a **basic level of French**.📕

## 🎯 Current Goals  
- 🔍 Enhancing meteorological predictions using **Graph Neural Networks** in my final degree project.  
- 📈 Exploring innovative AI techniques to improve climate and weather forecasting.

## ⚡ Fun fact  
Besides meteorology and AI, I **love exploring nature**! 🍃 Whether it's **hiking in the mountains**, **foraging for mushrooms in autumn**, or **skiing in winter**, I enjoy being outdoors and experiencing the changing seasons firsthand. I also have a deep passion for **music**! 🎶 I play the **trumpet** 🎺 and the **piano** 🎹, and I love **singing and composing my own songs**. Whether it's performing live or creating new melodies, music has always been an important part of my life.
